    "<B> DECISION TREE : <B> Decision tree is a tree shaped diagram used to determine a course of action. Each brach of the tree represents a possible decision or reaction or occurance. It can solve both problem of classification and regression. It is based on entropy which is measure of degree of randomness or unpredictability in datasets. Example collection of all animals of the forest. Decrease in entropy after spliting the dataset is called gain of information. Leaf node carries the classification or decision and the top most decision node is called root node. Formula for entropy calculation is sum of probability of each event to occur multiply with the log base2 of the same probability. As spliting increases the entropy decreases and lastly end up with the individual values or label in given by leaf node."
